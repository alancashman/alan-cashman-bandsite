                    The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco, California.  The band consists of lead vocalist Bryan Teddy, guitarist Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green, bassist Kent Zulkee and drummer Freddie Fischer.  The band achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing attention from manager Cam Adams.  Having worked with other popular acts (The Elephant in the Room, One Trick Pony, The Cat's Meow), Adams was confident the band would succeed even further, pushing them to sign with Magenta Records.

Looking forward to touring in the future, The Bees Knees are currently recording their second studio album, looking to be released in late 2021.
